### Librairies

These archives must be unzipped then added to the project as librairies.

You can do these steps :

* right clic on the project
* -> **Build Path** -> **Configure Build Path**
* Under the **Java Build Path** (on the left panel) and the **Librairies** tab, *edit/replace* .jar as they're not located in the same directory according to the machine.
* Add all librairies' jar to each different librairie.
